# CiteMyWeb

CiteMyWeb is a handy web app that simplifies the citation process for research articles. It's designed to save researchers time by extracting the appropriate Digital Object Identifier (DOI) directly from the article URL, rather than requiring manual input of the DOI or article name. CiteMyWeb is an open-source project, developed using Flask, and is hosted on Railway.

This tool currently supports more than 40 research article websites and provides a range of citation styles to choose from. Users can easily copy the generated citation and paste it into their research paper, thesis, or any other document. 

In the future, I aim to extend CiteMyWeb to accommodate all types of articles, web pages, and books, broadening its usability beyond the academic community. This will include even deriving citations from Amazon URLs for books without the need for an International Standard Serial Number (ISSN) or other information.

The project is always looking for improvement, both in terms of additional features and the user interface/user experience (UI/UX).
